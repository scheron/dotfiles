# Armed only by a run marker (.ai-workflow/run/<plan>/RUN, written by
# ds-implement and cleared by ds-finish). Outside a run this hook does nothing:
# an unconditional block on reset/merge/rebase would break ordinary work in every
# repository, which is why the marker exists at all.
#
# The script itself is not exempted and does not need to be: PreToolUse sees the
# command the model runs (`ds-finish squash …`), and the git calls inside the
# script never pass through a hook.
#
# Fail-open: on any parsing error the command is allowed. A guard that blocks by
# accident is worse than one that misses.
